# Streamr development environment

This repository contains Docker compose files and command line tool `streamr_docker_dev` for setting up a local Streamr development environment. The environment consists of Streamr services and supporting (3rd party) services. The data of the services is persisted on the local disk.

## Setting up

### OS X

1. Download, install, and run [Docker Community Edition for Mac](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac).

2. Increase the amount of memory allocated to Docker VM from 2GB to something
   like 5GB or more (Docker icon -> Preferences -> Advanced). Click Apply & Restart.

3. Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:streamr-dev/streamr-docker-dev.git`, change into that directory `cd streamr-docker-dev`

4. Create a symlink to `streamr-docker-dev` into a suitable directory in your PATH (run from repository root):
```
ln -sf $(pwd)/streamr-docker-dev/bin.sh /usr/local/bin/streamr-docker-dev
```

### Linux

1. Install and start Docker service.

2. Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:streamr-dev/streamr-docker-dev.git`, change into that directory `cd streamr-docker-dev`

3. Add `streamr-docker-dev` into a suitable directory in your PATH (run from repository root), e.g.:
```
ln -sf $(pwd)/streamr-docker-dev/bin.sh /usr/local/bin/streamr-docker-dev
```

### Windows

The docker stack has not been tested in a Windows environment and is not recommended at this time.

## Quickstart

**Option 1**
- Start the full stack and wait until it's up and running: `streamr-docker-dev start --wait `
- Browse to [http://localhost](http://localhost) to use the Core UI
- Log in with your Ethereum wallet (install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) if you don't have one)

**Option 2**
- Start the full stack and wait until it's up and running: `streamr-docker-dev start --except platform --wait `
- Install and run the Streamr Platform independantly - [Streamr Platform Repo](https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-platform/blob/development/app/README.md)
- Browse to [http://localhost](http://localhost) to use the Core UI
- Log in with your Ethereum wallet (install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) if you don't have one)

Option 2 is for when you would like to make changes to the frontend (Platform) code.

### Interacting with the local blockchain

The local Streamr Stack is configured to interact with the local Ethereum Parity node. Transactions should be near instant.

The recommended way to interact with the blockchain is through Metamask. Here is the network configuration to add:
- Network Name: Streamr Local
- RPC URL: http://localhost:8545
- ChainID: 8995

### Getting ETH on the local blockchain

There are pre-filled wallets with ETH & DATA on this chain to use.

### Troubleshooting

Metamask can often get stuck when transacting on many different networks. A handy trick is to "Reset Account" in Settings/Advanced. This will remove the transaction history which helps it get unstuck.

## Accessing the Core app and Streamr API

Once the services are running, browse to [http://localhost](http://localhost) to use Core.

The API root is at `http://localhost/api/v1`.

## Usage in Streamr development

When you're developing one of the Streamr components, you'll want to use the `streamr-docker-dev` tool with the `--except` flag to exclude the service you're developing:

```
streamr-docker-dev start --except [service-under-development]
```

## Usage in testing and CI

In CI, the `--wait` flag can be used with `start` to block until all health checks are passing. This ensures that the services are up and running before starting your tests.

For integration tests, use the `--except` option to exclude the service under test: 

```
streamr-docker-dev start --except [service-under-test] --wait
```

When testing the SDKs or running other end-to-end tests, just start the full stack before your tests: 

```
streamr-docker-dev start --wait
```

## Troubleshooting

### Making image uploads to AWS work

Uploading images to AWS needs credentials to be able to access the target S3 bucket.

1. copy `.env.example` as `.env` and change the values to correct ones
(Note: `.env` file is in `.gitignore`)

2. Restart `engine-and-editor` and S3 services should work. You can debug any
   potential issues with `streamr-docker-dev log -f engine-and-editor`.

### Error response from daemon
`Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)`

This is a connection issue; could be DNS settings, could be firewall. For me, changing to another wlan helped.

I received this error only during `docker login`, after login I could resume using office wlan (`docker pull` works somehow differently).
